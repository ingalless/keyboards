# KB Paradise V60 Type R Ingalless

This layout removes caps_lock in favour of escape key.
It also puts tilde where the escape key usually is.

## Keymap Notes
- Does not support control for in-switch or underglow lighting
- Keymap is not the same as other KBP V60 keyboards


### Build
To build this keymap, simply run `make v60_type_r:default`.

On Windows, launch QMK MSYS and run `qmk compile -kb v60_type_r -km ingalless`
